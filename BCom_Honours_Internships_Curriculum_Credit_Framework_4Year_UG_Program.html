    <h2 class="section-title">Credit Allocation and Requirements for Internships</h2>
    <p>Under the University of Calcutta’s <em>Curriculum and Credit Framework (CCF)</em> for 4-year undergraduate programs (as per NEP 2020), an internship is a mandatory component of the B.Com (Honours) course. <strong>All B.Com (Hons) students must complete one Summer Internship worth 3 academic credits</strong> during their program. This single internship (of <strong>3 credits</strong>) can be undertaken at the end of either the 2nd, 4th, or 6th semester, depending on the student’s progress and plans. The internship is integrated into the credit structure of the curriculum – meaning those <strong>3 credits count toward the total credits required for the degree</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Internship Timing and Exit Options</h2>
    <p>The timing of the internship is aligned with the multiple exit options introduced under the new framework:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>After 1 Year (2 semesters)</strong>: If a student completes the internship at the end of Semester 2 and chooses to exit, they are eligible for a <strong>Certificate</strong> (having earned 45 credits in total).</li>
        <li><strong>After 2 Years (4 semesters)</strong>: Completing the internship by the end of Semester 4 and exiting yields a <strong>Diploma</strong> (with 88 credits).</li>
        <li><strong>After 3 Years (6 semesters)</strong>: Completing the internship by the end of Semester 6 and exiting earns the student a <strong>Three-Year B.Com degree or B.Com Honours degree</strong> (with 128 credits).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These credit totals (45, 88, 128 credits respectively) explicitly include the 3-credit internship. The <strong>3-credit internship is thus an academic requirement for all B.Com (Hons) students</strong>, ensuring that even those who take an early exit have practical training as part of their curriculum.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Internship Credits for Students Continuing to 4th Year (No Early Exit)</h2>
    <p>Importantly, <strong>students who do not opt for an early exit</strong> (i.e., those who continue through the full 4-year B.Com Honours program) <strong>still must complete the internship and receive the 3 credits for it.</strong> The internship is not only for exit qualifications but is a <strong>compulsory part of the degree curriculum</strong> for everyone. According to the official framework, students are allowed to take the internship in Semester II, IV, or VI at their convenience, and <strong>upon completion of the internship (with a certificate from the host organization), the 3 credits are awarded</strong> and added to the student’s credit tally.</p>
    <p>In other words, <strong>even if a student continues to the 7th and 8th semesters (the 4th year), they will have completed the internship earlier and those credits remain part of their academic record.</strong> The 3-credit internship counts toward the total credits required for the B.Com (Hons) degree, whether or not the student uses the exit option. By the end of the four-year program, a B.Com (Hons) student will have earned <strong>172 credits in total</strong>, which includes the same 3 internship credits (the remaining credits coming from coursework and, in the 4th year, additional advanced courses or a research project). The internship’s credit value and its fulfillment are thus applicable to all students, serving as a required credit-bearing component of the curriculum rather than an optional or exclusively exit-related add-on.</p>
